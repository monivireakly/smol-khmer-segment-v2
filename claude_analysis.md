# Feature Importance and Transition Analysis

## Top Features
- **Strongest predictors**: Trigrams and character-specific features.
- **High weight for** `្ច` **sequence**:  
  - Weight: **8.63**  
  - Suggests strong consonant cluster detection.
- **Diacritic sequences**:  
  - Important predictors with weights between **5.5-5.9**.
- **Dictionary features**:  
  - Balanced weights (~**4.86**) for **B/O labels**.

## Feature Distribution
- **Trigrams**:  
  - Heavy reliance (**27,202 features**) - provides strong contextual understanding.
- **Bigrams**:  
  - Decent number (**5,223 features**).
- **Dictionary features**:  
  - Relatively few (**297 features**) - indicates the model isn't overly dependent on lexicon-based predictions.
- **Character-type features**:  
  - Very few, but used sparingly and effectively.

## State Transitions
- **B->B transition**:  
  - Strong negative weight (**-5.71**) - prevents consecutive word starts.
- **O->B and B->O transitions**:  
  - Positive weights (**0.03** and **0.16**, respectively) - captures natural word structure.
- **O->O transition**:  
  - Slight negative weight (**-0.01**) - allows for multi-character words.

## Assessment
- **Linguistic awareness**:  
  - Model shows good awareness of key linguistic features like diacritics and consonant clusters.
- **Balanced feature usage**:  
  - Effective use of n-grams and character features.
- **Natural transitions**:  
  - Transition weights reflect the natural structure of Khmer words.
- **Lexicon independence**:  
  - Model isn't overly reliant on dictionary features, indicating good generalization potential.

### Conclusion
The feature distribution and weights appear appropriate for Khmer segmentation. No red flags were found in the analysis.
